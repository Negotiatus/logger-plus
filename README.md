# LoggerPlus

LoggerPlus adds splats to the various log levels provided in `ruby/logger`, and reformats the messages to a hash representation, allowing for simple migration to a JSON logger.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'logger_plus'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install logger_plus

## Usage

LoggerPlus extends ::Logger directly, so extend LoggerPlus or use as a direct dropin for ::Logger.
LoggerPlus will also intelligently extend LogStashLogger's MultiLogger, which allows it to play nicely with LogStashLogger.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
